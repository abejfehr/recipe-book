## Seafood

### Unagi Don

I originally made this dish with an [American Eel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_eel) that I purchased from a local [T&T](http://www.tnt-supermarket.com/en/index.php?), without knowing anything about how to prepare it. The man bagged the fish for me and laughed at me, knowing that I had no idea what I was doing. 

Things I learned later:
- Eel blood is *toxic*, be careful when handling the fish
- American Eels are *endangered*, there's some likelihood that this species will go extinct because they're too delicious. Eat sparingly(or not at all)
